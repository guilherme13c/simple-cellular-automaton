# ToDo

- [ ] Change mouse button interaction to set instead of toggle (left button sets cell to 1, right button sets it to 0).
- [ ] Use other thread to draw in order to manage user's input seamlessly while not affecting simulation speed.
- [ ] Make rules editable, so the user can define the rules without changing the kernel file.
